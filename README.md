A smart AI based solution for traffic manageme nt on routes with heavy traffic from different directions, with realtime monitoring and adaptation of traffic light timings.

## Description
Key Features:
- Adaptive Traffic Lights: Using AI, the system can change traffic light sequences based on current traffic volumes, minimizing wait times at intersections.
- Coordinated management of multiple intersections
- Adaptive traffic light control using reinforcement learning for optimal flow
- Priority To Emergency Vehicles: The program is designed to efficiently process traffic data from all directions, and allow quick passage to emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks.
- Scalable architecture for future expansion and integration with smart city initiatives

## Technical Approach
Develop a robust data processing pipeline to clean, aggregate, and store incoming data streams efficiently.
Create advanced AI models using machine learning and deep learning techniques for accurate traffic prediction and optimization.
Design a real-time decision engine that combines AI insights with predefined rules to control traffic lights dynamically.
Build scalable cloud infrastructure to handle high-volume data processing and support system growth.
Develop user-friendly interfaces including a web dashboard for traffic management personnel and a mobile app for the public.
Ensure system interoperability through standardized APIs and protocols for seamless integration with existing city infrastructure and future smart city initiatives.
